# Magenizr ResetUiBookmarks
Reset UI Bookmarks becomes an invaluable tool while working daily in the admin panel, especially on MagentoÂ® instances with a large catalogue. The regular use of grid filters, applied sorting ( e.g `Sales > Orders or Catalog > Product` ) or other options provided by third party integrations can cause server time-outs ( depending on the filter combinations ) and make the grid tables unusable. With Reset UI Bookmarks any admin user can reset their filters back to default without having an agency support team involved.

## Business Value
Usually a technical person ( e.g developer ) is required to reset those filters back to default. This can be annoying for a client and create unnecessarily noise for a developer team. Here are the advantages of Reset UI Bookmarks.

* A client can reset filters and column positions back to default. A developer is not required.
* A client support team, which usually has no access to the MySQL database can fix broken grid tables without having a developer involved.
* Practical for small businesses, which can not afford expensive agency support.
